# Vortex

A modern BitTorrent client built entirely from scratch in Python.

Vortex implements the BitTorrent protocol from the ground up, including tracker communication, peer discovery, piece scheduling, SHA-1 verification, resume support, rarest-first piece selection, endgame mode, and multi-peer downloading — all wrapped in a clean PyQt6 desktop interface.
